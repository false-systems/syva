## Languages

Code in this repository is **Rust, or Elixir/Erlang**. Never add Python, Go
or Node (JavaScript/TypeScript): not for tools, scripts, CI helpers, tests,
dashboards or glue. A thin shell step in a CI workflow is fine; anything with
logic is Rust. Existing Python or Node files are debt to be rewritten, not
precedent to follow.
